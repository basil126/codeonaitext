# Image to Text API

API meant for other people to use so they can upload images and return text from the images which could be used in android applications to read out text outloud.

run main.py (py main.py) then go to this url:

http://127.0.0.1:5000/upload?image=example_url

then wait for the api to return the results (list of strings)
